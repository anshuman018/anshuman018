## 👨‍💻 About Me (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Segmentation Faults)

Oh, you want to know about me? *adjusts imaginary glasses dramatically* 

I'm a Software Engineer who speaks more languages than a UN interpreter, except mine compile to bytecode and occasionally crash your browser. I debug in my sleep and dream in hexadecimal. My code is so clean, Marie Kondo asked for lessons. My algorithms are so optimized, they make O(1) look sluggish.

Currently breaking things professionally while pretending it's "feature testing" 🔥

## 🚀 My Arsenal of Digital Destruction

### Languages I Fluently Break Things In:
- **Brainfuck** - Because why use Python when you can suffer? `>++++++++[<+++++++++>-]<.`
- **Malbolge** - The programming language that laughs at your pain
- **Piet** - I write code that looks like abstract art (and performs about as logically)
- **Chef** - My programs are literally recipes. My Hello World tastes delicious
- **LOLCODE** - Because professionalism is overrated: `HAI! VISIBLE "OMG HIRING MANAGERS"! KTHXBYE`
- **Whitespace** - I code in invisible characters. My IDE looks empty but my soul is full
- **Ook!** - I learned to code from an orangutan. Don't ask.
- **Shakespeare** - My code reads like Hamlet but performs like a B-grade sitcom
- **ArnoldC** - `GET TO THE CHOPPER` is my favorite loop declaration
- **Chicken** - Yes, it's real. No, you don't want to know.

### Technologies That Make Me Question My Life Choices:
- **WebAssembly** compiled from **Rust** compiled from **C++** compiled from **Assembly** written in **Vim**
- **Quantum Computing** with **Qiskit** (Schrödinger's debugging - my code works until observed)
- **Solidity** for smart contracts that are neither smart nor contractual
- **COBOL** because apparently I enjoy archaeological programming
- **Prolog** - Logic programming that defies all logic
- **Forth** - Stack-based programming that stacks confusion upon confusion
- **APL** - One line of code that does everything and nothing simultaneously
- **J** - APL's minimalist cousin that makes Perl look readable

### Databases I've Made Cry:
- **Neo4j** - Graphs so complex they need therapy
- **CouchDB** - Relaxed database for my relaxed attitude toward data integrity
- **Redis** - My memory is faster than your storage
- **InfluxDB** - Time-series data that transcends the space-time continuum
- **Apache Cassandra** - Distributed like my attention span
- **ScyllaDB** - Because regular databases don't crash fast enough

### Frameworks That Have Seen Things:
- **Svelte** compiled to **Web Components** running on **Deno** deployed via **GitHub Actions** to **Vercel Edge Functions**
- **Three.js** with **WebGL2** shaders written in **GLSL** that render my existential dread in 60fps
- **Phoenix LiveView** - Real-time web apps that update faster than my imposter syndrome
- **Blazor WASM** - C# in the browser because JavaScript wasn't cursed enough

### DevOps Tools That DevOp More Than They Should:
- **Kubernetes** clusters that cluster more than my thoughts at 3 AM
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as Code as Therapy as Life Philosophy
- **Istio** service mesh that's more tangled than my headphone cables
- **ArgoCD** - GitOps so advanced it deploys my emotional state
- **Helm** charts that chart uncharted territories of configuration complexity

## 🎯 Current Mission: Operation Syntax Terror

- 🔭 Building a **blockchain-powered AI** that writes **quantum-resistant smart contracts** in **WebAssembly** deployed on **IPFS**
- 🌱 Learning **Haskell** monads to finally understand what a burrito has to do with programming
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on projects that make senior developers question their career choices
- 💬 Ask me about implementing **red-black trees** in **Brainfuck** or why I have 47 unfinished side projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once wrote a sorting algorithm so fast it sorted my life problems (it didn't work)

## 📊 GitHub Stats That Definitely Matter

## 🎨 When I'm Not Breaking Production

- 🎮 Playing games where the physics engines are more stable than my code
- 📚 Reading about design patterns I'll never implement correctly
- 🎵 Listening to lo-fi hip hop while my tests fail in the background
- 🍕 Contemplating whether this pizza delivery app really needs microservices architecture
