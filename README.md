## About Me

I'm a software engineer who enjoys pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code. I believe in learning through experimentation—even when it means spending 16 hours debugging a segfault caused by typing `maim` instead of `main`.

My approach to programming combines practical problem-solving with exploration of unconventional languages and technologies. I maintain clean repositories and believe that every bug is an opportunity to learn something new.

## Technical Skills

- **Esoteric Programming**: Brainfuck, Whitespace, and other unconventional languages
- **Systems Programming**: Rust, WebAssembly for performance-critical applications  
- **Web Development**: Modern JavaScript/TypeScript, Python for rapid prototyping
- **Cloud Architecture**: AWS (Certified Solutions Architect - because apparently I enjoy paying for my own suffering), GCP, Azure
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Building intelligent systems and quantum computing experiments
- **DevOps**: Kubernetes, Docker, multi-cloud infrastructure management
- **Problem Solving**: Debugging complex issues and optimizing performance

## Current Projects

I'm working on experimental applications that combine AI, quantum computing, and cloud technologies with practical use cases. These projects leverage WebAssembly for performance optimization and explore the intersection of emerging technologies. While some are proof-of-concepts, they demonstrate approaches to solving complex problems with cutting-edge tooling across AWS, GCP, and Azure platforms.

## Professional Background

I specialize in cloud architecture and emerging technologies, with hands-on experience across major cloud platforms. My work spans from traditional software engineering to experimental applications in AI and quantum computing.

## Interests Beyond Code

- **Gaming**: Competitive gaming helps develop quick decision-making skills
- **System Architecture**: Designing scalable solutions, sometimes over-engineering simple problems for learning purposes
- **Technology Discussion**: Engaging with the developer community about best practices and emerging trends

## Connect
