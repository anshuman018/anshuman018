👨‍💻 About Me (aka Who Gives a Shit?)

Hey, I’m a software engineer who knows more coding languages than friends—big flex, right? I debug code in my sleep and dream in binary, because my life’s that fucking thrilling. My code’s so clean, it’d make your grandma weep. Right now, I’m breaking shit at work and calling it "innovation."

🚀 Skills That Make Me Hate Myself Less





Brainfuck: Why use Python when you can fucking torture yourself?



Whitespace: My code’s invisible, just like my chances of a promotion.



WebAssembly: Because regular assembly wasn’t shitty enough.

🎯 Current Project: Operation Clusterfuck

Building some blockchain-AI-quantum bullshit in WebAssembly. It’s as useful as a dick-flavored lollipop, but it keeps me busy.

🎨 Hobbies (When I’m Not Fucking Up Prod)





Gaming, because those physics engines don’t crash as hard as my code.



Wondering why the fuck my pizza app needs Kubernetes.
