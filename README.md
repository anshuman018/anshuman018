## 💾 About Me (aka Why the Fuck Am I Still Coding?)
I'm a software engineer with more Git conflicts than brain cells—guess which one I use more? I write code so obscure, it makes Malbolge look like a fucking children's book. My repos are cleaner than Zuck's privacy policy, but my life's messier than a PHP codebase from 2003. ☕ I'm currently "revolutionizing" prod at work by breaking shit and yelling "it's not a bug, it's a feature!"

My proudest moment? Spent 16 hours debugging a segfault only to find out I'd typo'd `main` as `maim`. I'm basically the Steve Jobs of fucking up, minus the turtleneck and cult following. 💥

## ⚔️ Skills That Make Me Hate Myself Slightly Less
- 🧬 **Brainfuck**: Because I'd rather write code that looks like a drunk AI's fever dream than touch Java. Fuck that noise.
- 👤 **Whitespace**: My commits are ghostlier than my chances of surviving a code review with DHH.
- 🌀 **WebAssembly**: For when I need to make my CPU scream louder than a Tesla fanboy at a keynote.
- 🦀 **Rust**: So I can lord it over C++ devs while crying over lifetimes at 2 a.m.
- 🐍 **Python**: For when I need to write a script in 5 minutes but spend 5 days cursing pip's dependency hell.

## 🎯 Current Project: Operation Clusterfuck Prime
I'm slapping together a blockchain-AI-Web3-quantum shitstorm in WebAssembly that's about as useful as a fucking NFT of a paperclip. It's got more dependencies than a Silicon Valley startup and crashes harder than Twitter during an AWS outage. Why? Because I'm a masochist, and "works on my machine" is my goddamn mantra. 🛠️

## 🎭 Hobbies (When I'm Not Fucking Up Prod)
- 🎮 **Gaming**: Getting rekt in Apex Legends because my aim's shittier than a janky regex in prod.
- 🍔 **Overengineering Takeout**: Built a burger-ordering app with Kubernetes, Prometheus, and a fucking Istio mesh. Still got cold fries. Thanks, microservices.
- 📉 **Shitposting on X**: Roasting bad TypeScript takes and crying about my $900 AWS bill from a "serverless" app.

## 🌐 Stalk Me (Or Fuck Off, Your Choice)
- **Portfolio**: [anshumanos.vercel.app](https://anshumanos.vercel.app) — Code I didn't `rm -rf` in a rage.
- **X**: [@anshumanos](https://twitter.com/anshumanos) — Where I dunk on React hooks and scream about Docker's bullshit.
- **Stack Overflow**: I'm the sad fuck with 3 upvotes on a 2015 question about jQuery. Yes, I regret it.

*"Code's like a fucking startup: you pour your soul into it, and it still shits the bed at scale."*
